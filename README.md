Welcome to the Github repository for our study, entitled "How far Iâ€™ll go: Social infrastructure accessibility and proximity in urban neighborhoods", published in Landscape and Urban Planning (2023). This repository contains all code, scripts, and datasets necessary for replicating this study. We hope that this repository can help support further study of social infrastructure. 

## Table of Contents

See below for a brief outline of key code files for replicating this study. (Note: While early versions of the code are documented in the `code.Rmd` and `code.html` files, please ignore these - these are deprecated. Our final replication files are listed in order, always starting with a number (eg. `00_dataverse_download.R`, `01_descriptives.R`, etc.).) These are listed below **in order.**

- [`00_dataverse_download.R`](https://github.com/timothyfraser/social_infra_distance/blob/main/00_dataverse_download.R): code to download large files from the Harvard Dataverse. 
- [`00_keys_template.R`](https://github.com/timothyfraser/social_infra_distance/blob/main/00_keys_template.R): example `keys` file of environmental variables you will need to make in order to run various code in this project.
- [`00_packages.R`](https://github.com/timothyfraser/social_infra_distance/blob/main/00_packages.R): script to install pacakges.
- [`01_descriptives.R`](https://github.com/timothyfraser/social_infra_distance/blob/main/01_descriptives.R): descriptive statistical analysis of datasets.
- [`02_data.R`](https://github.com/timothyfraser/social_infra_distance/blob/main/02_data.R): script to generate key data files used in figures.
- [`03_figure_1.R`](https://github.com/timothyfraser/social_infra_distance/blob/main/03_figure_1.R): replication code for paper Figure 1.
- [`03_figure_2.R`](https://github.com/timothyfraser/social_infra_distance/blob/main/03_figure_2.R): replication code for paper Figure 2.
- [`03_figure_3_to_5.R`](https://github.com/timothyfraser/social_infra_distance/blob/main/03_figure_3_to_5.R): replication code for paper Figures 3-5.
- [`03_figure_6.R`](https://github.com/timothyfraser/social_infra_distance/blob/main/03_figure_6.R): replication code for paper Figure 6.
- [`03_figure_A1.R`](https://github.com/timothyfraser/social_infra_distance/blob/main/03_figure_A1.R): replication code for paper Figure A1.
- [`03_figure_A2.R`](https://github.com/timothyfraser/social_infra_distance/blob/main/03_figure_A2.R): replication code for paper Figure A2.
- [`03_figure_A3.R`](https://github.com/timothyfraser/social_infra_distance/blob/main/03_figure_A3.R): replication code for paper Figure A3.
